# Adventures with a Chacon Smart Socket

I did not buy the socket here, but for reference [this is the model I bought](https://www.coolblue.be/en/product/822042/chacon-smart-connector-wifi.html).

I found [this forum](https://userbase.be/forum/viewtopic.php?t=43576&start=20) that details some of the tweakable settings via the telnet port. This is sort of a security risk, so I will reconfigure appropriately. It does seem quite outdated. A proper nmap scan of the IP address (`192.168.0.188`) is in order.
